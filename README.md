# JBus Backend Service

## Overview

This repository contains the backend service for the JBus Android application, which is responsible for all the server-side operations of the bus reservation system. The backend is built with robust and scalable Java technologies, providing a strong foundation for the application's functionality.

The front-end code for JBus is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/kamalMakarim/JBus-android/tree/master).

## Project Structure

The backend project is structured into several Java packages:

### `controller`
This package contains all the controller classes that handle HTTP requests and responses. They are the entry points for the APIs provided by the backend service.

#### AccountController
Manages all account-related operations such as user authentication and profile management.

#### BaseResponse
A utility class that standardizes the API response structure throughout the application.

#### BasicGetController
Handles basic GET requests for retrieving data without complex business logic.

#### BusController
Manages operations related to bus data, such as retrieving bus details and schedules.

#### PaymentController
Processes payment transactions and manages payment data.

#### StationController
Handles all operations related to bus stations, including station information and associated schedules.

### `dbjson`
This package includes classes that interact with the database in the JSON format for data persistence.

### `json`
Contains classes that define the JSON structure for various entities used in the application.

#### Account
Represents the JSON structure for user account data.

#### Algorithm
Defines the algorithm used for processing data, such as search algorithms for bus routes.

#### BookingThread
Handles the threading for booking operations to ensure efficient processing.

#### Bus
Specifies the JSON format for bus data.

#### BusType
Describes the JSON structure for different types of buses.

#### City
Represents the JSON structure for city data relevant to bus routes.

#### Facility
Defines the facilities offered by the bus service in JSON format.

#### Invoice
Structures invoice data in JSON for processing and storage.

#### JBus
The core class that defines the JSON structure for the main application data.

#### Payment
Outlines the payment information in JSON format.

#### Predicate
Utilizes functional interfaces to handle filtering and querying of data.

#### Price
Defines the pricing structure in JSON.

#### Rating
Represents the JSON format for user ratings of bus services.

#### Renter
Describes the JSON structure for renters of bus services.

#### Review
Manages the JSON format for user reviews.

#### Schedule
Specifies the JSON structure for bus schedules.

#### Station
Defines the JSON structure for bus station information.

#### Type
Generic class for defining types in JSON.

#### Validate
Ensures the validity of JSON data structures.

#### Voucher
Represents the JSON format for discount vouchers within the application.
